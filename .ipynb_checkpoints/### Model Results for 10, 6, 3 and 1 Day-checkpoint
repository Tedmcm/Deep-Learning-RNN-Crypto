### Model Results for 10, 6, 3 and 1 Day Window Sizes###

FNG INDEX Window size 10
1. The observable loss ratio was in range of .0225 to .0245. The observable loss ratio increased slightly 
   for the first couple of epochs but overall stayed flat through all 10. 
2. Evaluated Model loss ratio .12418 
3. The Price prediction at this windown length was very poor. It
   totally disconnected from the price after about a month and was 
   pretty much flat lined the whole time. During the first month it predicted
   a higher price than the actual price and then reversed to show a much lower
   price. In this FNG model window(10) there was a noticable pattern
   of missing the kick off to big moves, actually it initially predicted the
   opposite! 


FNG INDEX Window size 6
1. The observable loss ratio was in range of .0237 to .0254, while it went down 
   initially it rose after the 2nd epoch and finally peaked after the 4th. Overall
   it was pretty flat throughout. 
2. Evaluated model loss ratio was .10839
3  The price prediction was not any better at 6 window's vs 10, however it was 
   more volatile. It again over predicted the price for the first month and then 
   missed huge gains starting in May. In both FNG model window's(6 & 10) there was a noticable pattern
   of missing the kick off to big moves, actually it initially predicted the
   opposite! 

FNG INDEX Window size 3
1. The observable loss ratio was in range of .0314 to .0290, as with the other window's 
   the pattern was an up and down wave. There really wasn't a consistant trend. 
2. Evaluated model loss ratio was .11762
3. The predicted price again for the FNG was not good at all with really no improvement vs previous
   window's.

FNG INDEX Window size 1
1. The observable loss ratio was in range of .0517 to .0266, while the loss ratio started out higher
   it showed a trend lower throughout the epoch's till about half way through where it leveled out. 
2. Evaluated model loss ratio was .10977
3. The predicted price chart again shows the same pattern, over estimating for the first month
   and massively underestimating after about a month. Using this shorter window also definetly makes
   the forcast more volatile.

1. The observable loss ratio was in range of .0148 to .0134, The observable loss ratio rose initially
   and peaked about mid way through the epochs and gradually declined to end about flat. 
2. Evaluated model loss ratio .06742
3. The Price predicion was highly correlated out to about a month
   at which point it lost it's correlation/predictive value. For the first month 
   the price was spot on and then the actual price increased dramatically while
   the prediction stayed pretty flat.

1. The observable loss ratio was in range of .0176 to .0096, it initially rose
   and then peaked mid way through. After epoch 5 it fell the rest of the way to 
   end almost at 0. 
2. Evaluated model loss ratio .0532
3. The predicted price forcast improved noticably from the 10 window. Similar to the 
   10 day window the correlaton/prediction really broke down after April but 
   it definetly tracked prices after April better than the 10 day window. 


Bitcoin Closing Price Prediction using daily closing prices Window size 3
1. The observable loss ratio was in range of .0263 to .0070, the ratio slowly declined 
   through the epochs and showed a pretty good trend. 
2. Evaluated model loss ratio .03967
3. The predicted price forecast continued to show an improvement with a shorter window
   period. The correlation showed a meaningful improvement from April to June. 



Bitcoin Closing Price Prediction using daily closing prices Window size 1
1. The observable loss ratio was in range of .0448 to .0023, this window showed the best
   results by far, consistantly dropping to almost 0. 
2. Evaluated model loss ratio .03132
3. The predicted price forecast again showed a noticalable improvement from the 3 day window. 
   The most noticable part would be the improvement in the longer duration correlations. 


OVERALL OBSERVATIONS
1. The only predictive value of the FNG index appears to be the reverse correlation at 
   key inflection points, I could try further analysis to see if its possible to use this in a strategy. As with other asset 
   classes, sentiment is often wrong at trend changes. 
2. The 'Closing Price" model is a pretty good indicator over the short and medium term time
   horizons. The Evaluated loss metric continued to drop with the shorting of the windows which  
   tracked the overall improvement in the model. 
3. Shorter duration windows showed a much better predictive value.
